## Run

Running:

    ```bash
    python run.py

## Generating Migrations

1. **Create a New Migration**:
   To generate a migration script based on model changes, run:
   ```bash
   alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Migration description"
   ```
   This will create a new migration script in the `alembic/versions/` directory.

2. **Manually Edit (Optional)**:
   Review the generated migration script and make any necessary changes.

---

## Running Migrations

1. **Apply Migrations**:
   To apply all pending migrations, run:
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

2. **Rollback Migrations**:
   To revert the last migration, run:
   ```bash
   alembic downgrade -1
   ```

   To revert to a specific revision, use:
   ```bash
   alembic downgrade <revision_id>
   ```

---

## Checking Migration Status

1. **Current Revision**:
   Check the current revision applied to the database:
   ```bash
   alembic current
   ```

2. **Migration History**:
   View the history of all migrations:
   ```bash
   alembic history
   ```

3. **Show a Specific Migration**:
   Display details of a specific revision:
   ```bash
   alembic show <revision_id>
   ```
